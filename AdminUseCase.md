## 4. UX Flow (User Journey)

### 4.1 Login Process

The journey begins with the admin logging into the system.

1. **Access Login Page**
   - Admin navigates to the login page
   - Admin enters username and password

2. **Authentication**
   - System validates credentials
   - **Success:** Admin redirected to dashboard
   - **Failure:** Error message displayed with retry option

**Security:** Credentials encrypted during transmission  
**Error Handling:** Network issues trigger "Connection error, please try again"

### 4.2 Dashboard Navigation

Once logged in, the admin interacts with the dashboard to access various system sections.

1. **Dashboard View**
   - Admin views options: "User Management," "Content Management," "Settings," etc.

2. **Section Selection**
   - Admin selects desired section
   - System checks permissions for that section
   - **If allowed:** Admin directed to selected section
   - **If denied:** "Access Denied" message displayed, returns to dashboard

**Security:** Role-based authorization enforced  
**Error Handling:** Permission verification issues trigger "Unable to verify permissions, try again"

### 4.3 User Management Tasks

In the User Management section, the admin can perform various user-related actions.

#### Adding a New User

1. Admin clicks "Add User" to open form
2. Admin fills in user details (name, email, role, etc.)
3. Admin submits form
4. System validates input:
   - **Valid:** User added with success message
   - **Invalid:** Validation errors displayed for correction

**Security:** Verify admin permission before displaying form  
**Error Handling:** Network issues trigger "Unable to save, please try again"

#### Editing a User

1. Admin selects user from list
2. Admin clicks "Edit" to open user details form
3. Admin modifies details and submits changes
4. System validates and updates record:
   - **Success:** Changes saved with confirmation

**Security:** Verify edit permissions for specific user/role  
**Error Handling:** Concurrent edits trigger "Record locked, refresh and try again"

#### Deleting a User

1. Admin selects user from list
2. Admin clicks "Delete" button
3. System displays confirmation prompt
4. Admin confirms or cancels:
   - **Confirmed:** User deleted with confirmation
   - **Canceled:** Returns to user list without changes

**Security:** Restrict deletion to admins with explicit permissions  
**Error Handling:** Database errors trigger "Deletion failed, try again"

### 4.4 Error Handling Across the Flow

Comprehensive error handling ensures a smooth admin experience:

| Error Type | Message | Action |
|------------|---------|--------|
| **Network Errors** | "Connection lost, please try again" | Provides retry option |
| **Validation Errors** | Specific feedback (e.g., "Password must be 8+ characters") | Highlights affected fields |
| **Permission Errors** | "Access Denied" | Redirects to dashboard |
| **System Errors** | "An error occurred, contact support" | Logs error for troubleshooting |

### 4.5 Security Measures Across the Flow

Security protections implemented throughout the admin journey:

| Security Feature | Implementation |
|------------------|----------------|
| **Authentication** | Required for initial dashboard access |
| **Authorization** | Permission checks before access/actions |
| **Data Protection** | Sensitive data encrypted in transit and storage |
| **Audit Trail** | Admin actions logged for security audits |
