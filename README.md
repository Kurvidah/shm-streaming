# Project Setup

This project uses **Docker** to containerize a PHP application with a MySQL database. It includes automated setup scripts to manage environment variables, MySQL schema, seed data, and the container lifecycle.

---

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (with Docker Compose)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kurvidah/shm-streaming.git
cd shm-streaming
```

### 2. Configure `.env` file

The project uses a `.env` file for configuration. If the `.env` file does not exist, the setup script will automatically copy the `.env.example` file and prompt you to update it.

#### Example `.env` content:

```ini
DB_HOST=db
DB_NAME=mydatabase
DB_USER=myuser
DB_PASS=mypassword
DB_ROOT_PASS=rootpassword

PORT=8080
PMA_PORT=8081
```

- **DB_HOST**: MySQL container name (usually `db`)
- **DB_NAME**: Database name (e.g., `mydatabase`)
- **DB_USER**: MySQL user for the application
- **DB_PASS**: Password for the MySQL user
- **DB_ROOT_PASS**: Root password for MySQL
- **PORT**: The port on which the PHP app will run (default: `8080`)
- **PMA_PORT**: The port on which phpMyAdmin will be accessible (default: `8081`)

You can manually edit the `.env` file or use the provided `setup.sh` or `setup.bat` to automatically copy it from `.env.example`.

### 3. Run the setup script

#### For **Linux/macOS**:
Use the `setup.sh` script to start the project:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

#### For **Windows**:
Run the `setup.bat` script by double-clicking it or executing it in Command Prompt:

```cmd
setup.bat
```

The script will:

- **Check if Docker is running**.
- **Create the `.env` file** from `.env.example` if it doesn't already exist.
- **Stop and remove any existing containers**.
- **Clear the MySQL data volume**.
- **Rebuild and start the containers**.
- **Show the URLs** for accessing the app and phpMyAdmin.

---

## Containerized Services

### 1. **PHP Application**

Once the containers are up and running, the PHP app will be available at:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

### 2. **phpMyAdmin**

phpMyAdmin will be available for managing the MySQL database at:

```
http://localhost:8081
```

---

## Database Setup

The MySQL container will automatically:

1. **Create the database** from the `schema.sql` file.
2. **Populate it with seed data** from the `seed.sql` file.

Both the `schema.sql` and `seed.sql` files are located in the `db/` directory and are executed when the MySQL container starts for the first time.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Docker is not running

Ensure that **Docker Desktop** is running on your machine. You can verify this by running the following command:

```bash
docker info
```

If Docker is not running, start Docker Desktop and try running the setup script again.

### Containers are not starting correctly

To troubleshoot, view the logs of a specific container by running:

```bash
docker-compose logs <container_name>
```

Replace `<container_name>` with the name of the container, e.g., `mysql_db` or `php_app`.

---

## Customizing the Setup

You can modify the following files to change the default configuration:

- **`docker-compose.yml`**: Modify this file to adjust services, volumes, and other settings.
- **`db/schema.sql`**: Add or modify database schema and table definitions.
- **`db/seed.sql`**: Customize initial data inserted into the database.

---

## Stopping the Containers

To stop and remove the containers, run the following:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
